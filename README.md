# Welcome to my first python project!
## Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

### Description
This project is my first attempt at writing a Python program. It's an exciting journey of learning and exploring the Python programming language.

### Features
This is a simple Python project that allows you to play the classic game of rock-paper-scissors against the computer. It's a fun way to practice your Python skills and have some entertainment.

### Getting Started
To run the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to get started:

· Clone the project repository: git clone https://github.com/SkunkWorker1980/pythonml.git

· Run the Python program: python main.py

### How to Play
Launch the Python program by following the instructions in the "Getting Started" section.
When prompted, enter your choice of rock, paper or scissors.
The computer will randomly generate its choice.
